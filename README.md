# Group Project

Our solution to the project was done in parts. Intermediate results were saved to disc and loaded back up to be used in subsequent steps. Below is an overview of the files included in our submission, what they use as inputs and what they produce as outputs.

#### Part 1
- **Preprocessing.py:**
    - Input: The 955K.csv file
    - This script implements the preprocessing part of Part 1 and outputs a pandas dataframe containing the preprocessed documents and labels to a
    - pkl file.
- **exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb**
    - Input: The pkl file outputted by Preprocessing.py
    - Implements the exploratory data analysis part of Part 1
#### Part 2
- **one-hot-encoding.ipynb:**
      - Input: The pkl file outputted by Preprocessing.py
      - Implements one-hot encoding of the preprocessed dataset and outputs the results to a pkl file.
- **tf_idf**
- **logistic_regression.ipynb**
#### Part 3
- **naive_bayes.ipynb:** Implementerer del 3.

#### Part 4
- **model_evaluation**

#### Other files
- **Functions.ipynb:** Samling af functioner brugt i projektet
- **LIAR**
